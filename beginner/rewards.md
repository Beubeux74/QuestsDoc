# Rewards

Once you've familiarized yourself with the [Quests Editor](https://github.com/PikaMug/Quests/wiki/3-%E2%80%90-Quests-Editor), you may be wondering about the 'Edit Rewards' selection. This sub-menu contains prizes your player would receive upon completing the quest:

Note that the free mcMMO Classic is different than the paid mcMMO Overhaul, which is not natively supported. To use Quests with mcMMO Overhaul, you'll need [the module](https://github.com/PikaMug/Quests/wiki/Casual-%E2%80%90-Modules#mcmmo-overhaul) which loads under custom rewards.
